# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Model-using-Linear-Regression

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using a linear regression algorithm. The model is designed to estimate the cost of medical insurance based on various input features related to an individual's health and demographic information.

Features:

Age: The age of the individual.
Sex: Gender of the individual.
BMI: Body Mass Index, which measures body fat based on height and weight.
Children: The number of children or dependents covered by the insurance.
Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
Region: The geographic location of the individual.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and GitHub. It contains detailed records with attributes relevant to predicting insurance costs. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accurate and reliable model predictions.

Model:
The linear regression algorithm is employed to model the relationship between the input features and the medical insurance charges. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and validated to ensure its predictive performance.

Objective:
The primary goal of this model is to provide accurate predictions of medical insurance costs, aiding individuals and insurance companies in understanding and estimating insurance expenses.

Implementation:
The model is implemented using Python and standard libraries for data analysis and machine learning. Key libraries include Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the linear regression model, and Matplotlib for visualizing the results.

Usage:
To use this model, users can input their data into the trained model to obtain predicted insurance charges. The model can be further refined and optimized based on additional data and feedback.
